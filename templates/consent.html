<h4>You may decide to stop being a part of the research study at any time without explanation. You have the right to ask that any data you have supplied to that point be withdrawn/destroyed. You will still be paid for your contribution.

You have the right to omit or refuse to answer or respond to any question that is asked of you.

You have the right to have your questions about the procedures answered (unless answering these questions would interfere with the study’s outcome). If you have any questions as a result of reading this information sheet, you should ask the researcher before the study begins.</h4>
                   
<h2><b>CONFIDENTIALITY/ANONYMITY</b></h2>
<h4>The data we collect do not contain any personal information about you except some basic demographic details. No one will link the data you provided to the identifying information you supplied (e.g., name, age, sex). 

When your role with this project is complete, your data will be anonymised. From that time, there will be no record that links the data collected from you with any personal data from which you could be identified (e.g., your name, age, sex etc.). Up until the point at which your data have been anonymised, you can decide not to consent to having your data included in further analyses. Once anonymised, these data may be made available to researchers via accessible data repositories and possibly used for novel purposes.</h4>

<h2><b>CONSENT</b></h2>
<h4>By continuing below, you are agreeing that: <br>(1) you have read and understood the Participant Information Sheet, <br>(2) questions about your participation in this study have been answered satisfactorily, <br>(3) you are aware of the potential risks (if any), <br>(4) you are taking part in this research study voluntarily (without coercion), and <br>(5) anonymised data only may be shared in public research repositories.</h4>
